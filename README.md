I'm JosÃ© Miguel Romero, I'm starting in the world of software development, learning JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node.js. I want to grow and become a Full-Stack developer. I'm an adaptive person and committed to my work, a faithful believer in what you must work and strive for and never give up on what you want to obtain because "dreams are not expected, they are worked for"âœ¨
